# CS354_Machine_Organization_and_Programming

Learn how machines work by understanding properties of their organizations (VAS(Stack Frame), Memory Hierarchy(CPU, Cache, Register), Signal(Exception,send&receive), FileI/O(EOF,ROF,Loader))
and learn how to implement comparatively low-level language (C) and manage memory leak by using valgrind
Also, be able to analyze codes constructed with Assembly Language and understand how it is going to work


///////////////////////////////

P1: Understand how compiler works in Linux environment by decoding cipher texts
    using the Caesar cipher technique

///////////////////////////////

P2A: Understand how pointer works in C by constructing random sizes of a checkboard with pointer arithmetic
P2B: Programming practice by implementing magic square created automatically with the help of P2A  

///////////////////////////////

P3: Understand how heap memory works by constructing heap block that implements allocation, freeing, delayed coalescing 

///////////////////////////////

P4A: Understand cache memory allocation by analyzing Cache memory status
P4B: Deeply understand cache memory by constructing it that implements initialization, freeing, accessing(Cache hit, miss, eviction)

///////////////////////////////

P5: Practice reading Assembly Language by analyzing its code and translating to C (identify the password)

///////////////////////////////

P6: Understand Signal handling by making signal handler that implements <send, receive> with c and testing its file in two linux shells.
